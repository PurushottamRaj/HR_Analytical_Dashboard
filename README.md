# HR_Analytical_Dashboard
Developed an interactive HR Analytics dashboard to identify workforce trends, analyze employee performance, attendance, attrition patterns, and department-level KPIs. Applied data cleaning, visualization, and statistical methods to uncover meaningful insights. 

HR Analytics Dashboard
HR Analytics Dashboard analyzes employee attrition patterns using a comprehensive HR dataset, built with Power BI and Excel to identify turnover drivers and provide actionable insights.​

Project Overview
This project creates an interactive Power BI dashboard focused on employee attrition analysis from an HR dataset containing 1480 rows and 38 columns, including employee demographics, job details, and performance metrics. Key metrics reveal a 16.1% attrition rate, average employee age of 37 years, and average tenure of 11.3 years. The dashboard features KPI cards, donut charts, bar charts, and tables to visualize trends and support retention strategies.​
